## DataCamp Projects

As the scale and scope of datasets keeps increasing, the variety of statistical machine learning models is ever-growing. My DataCamp projects focuses on the most fundamental models, from their mathematical details to implementations, including:

**Cleaning and pre-processing data:  FIFA Women's World Cup match reports**
- Understand which match/stadium had the highest attendance during the Women's World Cup.

**Linear Regression: Kidney Stones and Simpson Paradox**
- In 1986, a group of urologists in London published a research paper that compared the effectiveness of two different methods to remove kidney stones. Treatment A was open surgery (invasive), and treatment B was percutaneous nephrolithotomy (less invasive). 
- When they looked at the results from 700 patients, treatment B had a higher success rate. However, when they only looked at the subgroup of patients different kidney stone sizes, treatment A had a better success rate. This known statistical phenomenon is called Simpon’s paradox. Simpon's paradox occurs when trends appear in subgroups but disappear or reverse when subgroups are combined.
- In this project, I am exploring Simpon’s paradox using multiple regression and other statistical tools.


**Time Series: The sisters and Google Trends**
- Explore the data underneath the hype of Kardashians and Jenners sisters using search interest data from Google Trends.
- Recreate the Google Trends plot to visualize their ups and downs over time, then make a few custom plots, and answer the big question: is Kim even the most famous sister anymore?

**Linear Classification: Disney Movies and Box Office Success**
- Explore a dataset of Disney movies and analyze what contributes to the success of Disney movies.
- The data contains 579 Disney movies with six features: movie title, release date, genre, MPAA rating, total gross, and inflation-adjusted gross.
